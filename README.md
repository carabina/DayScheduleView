# Day Schedule View

This repository implements a day schedule view control for iOS applications.
The day schedule view allows the user to view a 24-hour day and all of the
appointments that have been scheduled on that day. The day schedule view
supports [EventKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkit) for
displaying calendar events in the schedule.
